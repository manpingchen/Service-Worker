      <h2>What Is Service Worker?</h2>
      <p>Here is a quote from MDN</p>
      <blockquote
        cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API"
      >
        Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web
        applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are
        intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective
        offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate
        action based on whether the network is available, and update assets
        residing on the server. They will also allow access to push
        notifications and background sync APIs.
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A service worker is an event-driven worker registered against an
          origin and a path
        </li>
        <li>
          A service worker is run in a worker context: it therefore has no DOM
          access, and runs on a different thread to the main JavaScript that
          powers your app, so it is non-blocking.
        </li>
        <li>Service workers only run over HTTPS, for security reasons.</li>
